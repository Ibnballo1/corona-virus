# Corona Virus

This is my React capstone project for the React Redux Module. It is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) that will be created by making use of React and Redux. I will set up the environment and tools needed to develop a React application with Redux. In the following projects, I will develop the actual application. I selected an API that provides numeric data about a corona virus and then build the webapp around it. The webapp will have several pages.
